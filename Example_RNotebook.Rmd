This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


This is where I keep all of my notes & working thoughts on figure generation. When you "Knit" the R Notebook, it converts this markdown file to either PDF or HTML. This format is useful in place of creating a powerpoint of your figures, you can integrate your code and annotations all in one! And send to others as a single document. 

This first chunk is the setup chunk. Currently, this will not appear in your knitted document because of "include=FALSE" (i.e. don't include this chunk in the output). You can always remove "include=FALSE" argument from the brackets to make more transparent what was required for your notebook. 

**Here we do 4 things in the set up brackets:**

1. Designate this is R code (you can run other languages)
2. Load the built-in cars dataset
3. indicate global options are being set
4. indicate do NOT inclue this chunk in the knit document

**Then, set knitr options:** *Specifically, we tell knitr how to create figures and where to write them out (i.e. our repository!)*

**Then, we load any necessary packages used in the .Rmd**

```{r cars, global_options, include=FALSE}

knitr:: opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12,fig.height=8,dev = c('jpeg'), fig.path='figures/',echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

```

Above, I changed the font (bold, italicized), but there are built-in ways to organize your document. Different headings, as seen below, are useufl for guiding readers through a more "outlined" document. 

# Now we start plotting!

## Using built-in R data & Base R

### Don't forget to name the chunk!
```{r Cars-speed_dist}
cars

plot(cars$speed,cars$dist)

plot(cars$dist,cars$speed)

write.csv(cars)

```


# Plot Midwest Data

## Use ggplot

### Learn about plot strucure & themes!


```{r midwest}

data("midwest", package = "ggplot2")

midwest_df<-as.data.frame(midwest)

# Scatterplot
gg <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=state, size=popdensity)) + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess", se=F) + 
  xlim(c(0, 0.1)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 500000)) + 
  labs(subtitle="Area Vs Population", 
       y="Population", 
       x="Area", 
       title="Scatterplot", 
       caption = "Source: midwest")

gg_themed<- gg +  theme_tufte()

plot(gg)

plot(gg_themed)

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Some additional functionality with ggplot & Markdown

## In-line code!

There are `r nrow(midwest_df)` records in the Midwest dataset. 

### Can create a variety of graphics 

```{r}

options(scipen = 999)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggalt)
midwest_select <- midwest[midwest$poptotal > 350000 & 
                            midwest$poptotal <= 500000 & 
                            midwest$area > 0.01 & 
                            midwest$area < 0.1, ]

# Plot
ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=state, size=popdensity)) +   # draw points
  geom_smooth(method="loess", se=F) + 
  xlim(c(0, 0.1)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 500000)) +   # draw smoothing line
  geom_encircle(aes(x=area, y=poptotal), 
                data=midwest_select, 
                color="red", 
                size=2, 
                expand=0.08) +   # encircle
  labs(subtitle="Area Vs Population", 
       y="Population", 
       x="Area", 
       title="Scatterplot + Encircle", 
       caption="Source: midwest")

```


```{r}

# do some other plot
